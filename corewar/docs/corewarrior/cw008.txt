Core_Warrior_ is a weekly newsletter promoting the game of corewar.  Emphasis
is placed on the most active hills--currently the '94 draft hill and the
beginner hill.  Coverage will follow where ever the action is.  If you have
no clue what I'm talking about then check out these five-star internet locals

Greetings.

BIG changes this week.  The Pizza server has some new additions.  The
'Holding Pen' lists the queue of warriors awaiting battle much like the
StormKing page.  Beppe grilled Thos on the meanings of the numbers at the
bottom labeled load average and he had this to say:

3:39pm   load average: 3.49, 2.75, 2.68

The numbers are the load average for the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
1 / (load average) = % CPU pmars is getting.  During the day here load is
about 2.5, at night it drops to 1.8 or less.  When the pen finally empties,
the load average should go to less than 1.0.

Going by the "last challenge" times of the hill, it looks like it takes about
35 minutes to run the 94 hill with a load of around 2.5.  It looks like it
takes about 45 minutes to run the 94x hill, but that may just be standard
deviation.  Looks like a 94 + 94x challenge will take around 1:15 or so
during the day here, and a little under an hour at night.

Those are about as accurate as I can give you.

Pizza has also opened a new hill, the 5*40.  Also notice that five new slots
have opened up on the pizza hills and the number of battles was reduced to
200.  Makes the division easier for slow people like me.

We've said it once, and we'll say it again--the big (CORESIZE 55440) hill has
been reopened at the Stormking server, address: <koth@stormking.com>.
Access the hill with ;redcode-94x

In addition to Planar's Corner, we have the staffs'--M R Bremer's and Beppe
Bezzi's--tournament entires for you to enjoy along with comments by the
authors.  Check out Extra, Extra for all the goods.

The hints section is the last in the line in presenting basic warrior
strategies.  Maybe one more.  The question is:  where do we go from here?
Your input is always appreciated.  Also included in the hint:  a version of
myVamp by Magnus Paulsson.

Tournament Time:

The results of round 7 are in. To recap, the challenge was to beat your up to
500 line long opponent loaded at a fixed position halfway through core.  This
was an exciting round with huge score ranges.  Robert Macrae's Last Laugh won
by a land slide, with 90% wins. We saw some intriguingly new P-space
strategies, and we'd like to ask the top 3 contenders, Robert Macrae,
Myer Bremer and Beppe Bezzi to post their warriors with discussion of their
strategy.  (Editior's Note:  Macrae has already posted his warrior to the
newsgroup.  Bremer's and Bezzi's warrior are in Extra Extra.)

As this tournament draws to a close -- only 2 more rounds to go, it looks like
we're up for some up for some final stretch excitement. The lead of Steven
Morrell and Paul Kline has dwindled to a mere 9 points and the midfield is
densely packed with 5 players scoring between 48 and 51 points. The game is
still wide open. Just as a reminder, the GIFs of winner and two runners-up
will be featured in the upcoming Core War Hall of Fame at stormking -- how's
that for an incentive?

Good luck for the remaining rounds,
Nandor & Stefan

Two behemoths get pushed off this week.  Armory has been suffering for a
awhile and was finally pushed off by JKW's own test.  Phq has had similar
problems.  His last ditch defense (Saveme!) wasn't quite enough to keep it on
the hill.  Torch t18 and Jack in the box move up to claim the vacated spots.
Torch is in very good health, as high as third, as low as 11th, but overall
hanging around 5th or 6th.  Jack in the box is a super elastic yo-yo.  Bezzi
thought it may get pushed off soon, but it has hung out in the top 5 this
week and is currently in 11th place.  You'll have to see next week's issue
for the updated Hall of Fame.  Sorry.

quiz continues to dominate, usually enjoying a >10 point advantage.  Someone
_really_ needs to smash that thing.  Who would be king then? ;-)  La Bomba
RULED and is now sliding down the hill.  Are qscanners becoming ineffective?
Hector 2 is a qscan --> replicator.  Smart Bomb is a qscan --> p-warrior.
We'll see how these three fare in the weeks ahead.

The five additional slots on the hill means lots of new boys.  P.Kline
decided to increase his presence on the hill with the addition of Taking
Names (which pushed off Phq) and Die Hard.  Maurizio Vitturari has a warrior
under wraps that looks to be a worthy successor to Phq.

Twenty new entries on the hill this week.

Pulido has had solid lock on the hill lately.  Fire Master was seen on the
'94 draft hill for awhile.  The top 5 warriors are the same this week except
the absence of two of Franke's--Lurker and teamwork.  Franke has been trying
to gain a foothold on the '94 hill.  Hector 2 is in 16th place there.  His
test program is at the _top_ of the '94x hill.  Lewin has also claimed a
spot on the '94 hill with Night Train riding in 12th place.  From the looks
of his score, it seems to be some kind of Die Hard derivative.

Bezzi's test L 9 is in 20th place.  It was riding high on the '94 draft hill
if you can recall.  If your program dominates the b hill and fares poorly on
the '94 draft hill, don't lose confidence.  The composition of the hill has a
huge effect on how your warrior scores.  Keep trying.

                    The mathematics of imp steps

If you find this too mathematical, there is some redcode and cdb
macros in section 4.

0. Notations
------------
We'll talk about an imp number N and its corresponding imp step S in a
core of size C.  This will give us an N-point ring or spiral with this
instruction:

    MOV     0, S

N, S, and C must be such that, for some integer k,
        N*S = k*C + 1        (1)

Given C and N, the game is to find an S that satisfies equation (1).
We're not really interested in the value of k.  We'll call (N,S) an
imp pair in C.  When C is implicit from the context, we'll simply
say that (N,S) is an imp pair.

We can see that equation (1) is unchanged when we exchange N and S:
if (N,S) is an imp pair, then (S,N) is also an imp pair.

1. Existence
------------
Let me state here the most important theorem of mathematics (as far as
imp rings are concerned, anyway), Bezout's theorem:

For any integers x, y, and g, there exists integers u and v such that
        u*x + v*y = g        (2)
if and only if g is a multiple of the Greatest Common Divisor of x and y.

I won't explicitely prove Bezout's theorem here.  One of the
implications is easy, and the programs below are proof of the other.
Trust me, Bezout's theorem is true.

Let us take x = N, y = C, and g = 1, and equation (2) is almost the
same as equation (1):   u*N + v*C = 1

If we can find u and v that satisfy this relation, then (u,N) is an imp
pair.  Conversely, if (N,S) is an imp pair, then S*N + (-k)*C = 1, so 1
must be a multiple of GCD(N,C).  This means that 1 = GCD(N,C), so N
and C have no common factors.

Our first result is:
In a core of size C, there is an imp step for N if and only if N and
C have no common factor.

Examples:
In a core of size 8192 all odd numbers are imp numbers.
In a core of size 8000 all numbers ending in 1, 3, 7, or 9 are imp numbers.
In any core size, (1,1) is an imp pair.
In any core size C, (C-1,C-1) is  an imp pair.
In any odd core size C, ((C-1)/2,C-2) is an imp pair.

2. Unicity
----------
Assume that (N,S) and (N,T) are both imp pairs.  We have:
(a)      N*S = k*C + 1
(b)      N*T = i*C + 1

Subtracting (b) from (a), we get:
(c)      N*(S-T) = (k-i)*C

But N and C have no common factors, so S-T must be a multiple of C.
Thus, S = T + j*C: S and T are congruent modulo C.  In a redcode
program they are equal, since all redcode arithmetic is done modulo C.

Our second result is:
In a core of size C, if both (N,S) and (N,T) are imp pairs, then S
and T must be congruent modulo C, and thus equal, as far as redcode
programs are concerned.

3. Computation with recursion
-----------------------------
Computing the u and v parameters of equation (1) can be done with
Euclid's extended algorithm.  This is a simple extension of Euclid's
algorithm for computing the GCD.  Given x and y, Euclid's extended
algorithm will compute g = GCD(x,y) and values for u and v that make
equation (1) hold.

The algorithm is extremely simple.  You want to solve
       u*x + v*y = g

if x > y, solve u'*y + v'*x = g and take u = v', v = u'.
if x = 0, take g = y, u = 0, and v = 1.
else compute q and r such that y = q*x + r   and   0 <= r < x;
     solve  u'*r + v'*x = g;
     take u = v'-q*u' and v = u'.

This is the same as Euclid's algorithm except that you keep track of the
quotients of the divisions and use them to compute u and v.

4. Computation without recursion
--------------------------------
There is a version of Euclid's extended algorithm that uses a loop
instead of the recursion.  Instead of boring you with a description
of how it works, I'll simply give the code:

;redcode
;name Euclid's extended
;author Planar
;assert MAXLENGTH >= 15 && CORESIZE >= 16

; To compute the imp step for a given imp number,
; enter the imp number in the following line:

n       equ     3

; The program terminates with gcd (n,CORESIZE) in the a-value at
; address 0.  If this is 1, there is a spiral of size n, and the
; b-value at address 1 is the corresponding step.

; This program works in any core size, and it computes imp steps
; for that core size.

; Use the following cdb macro to display all the (N,S) imp pairs
; with N <= 100 in the current core size.
; imps=@ca z=0~!!~@ca z=z+1~@ed 0~dat z~@g~@0~if a==1~!!~@1~ca z,b~!1~@s~!100
; (and launch pMARS with -r 100)

        org     start

yx      dat     0, n          ; y = CORESIZE = 0
ab      dat     1, 0

done    equ     ab
start   sub.b   yx, q         ; (CORESIZE-n)
        div.b   yx, q         ; ((CORESIZE-n)/n)
        add.ab  #1, q         ; q = (CORESIZE-n)/n+1 = CORESIZE/n
loop    mul.ab  ab, q         ; (a*q)
        mov.x   ab, ab        ; (b);   b' = a
        sub.ba  q, ab         ; a' = b - a*q
        mov.x   yx, yx        ; (y);   y' = x
        sub.ab  yx, yx        ; (y - x)
        mod.ab  yx, yx        ; x' = (y-x) % x = y % x
        jmz.b   done, yx      ; We're done if x = 0
        mov.ab  yx, q         ; (y)
        div.b   yx, q         ; q' = y' / x'
        jmp     loop

q       end

This program is quite fast for every imp number N and core size C:
the number of loop iterations is bounded by 2*ceil(log N/log 2).

And this is a version entirely written in cdb macros:

euclid=@ca c=1,d=0~m eucloop
eucloop=!!~@ca t=d-y/x*c,d=c~@ca c=t,t=y%x~@ca y=x,x=t~if x!=0~!
imp-pairs=@ca s=$~@ca z=0~!!~@ca x=z=z+1,y=$+1~m euclid~if y==1~ca z,d~!s

(Do not try to tune your modem, the above is not line noise.)

This macro is much faster than Stefan's "imp-numbers", and it really
finds all imp pairs, whereas Stefan's misses a few.

To use it, save it in a file named "planar.mac", launch pMARS with the
core size you're interested in and type "m imp-pairs,planar.mac".
pMARS will list all (N,S) imp pairs.  When N = S, for some reason
pMARS will only display one of them.  (Bug or feature ?)

If you dislike negative numbers, just add CORESIZE to them.  This is
an easy exercise in cdb programming.

If you only want the reasonable imp numbers, change the "s" at the end
of the last line into 100, and it will display only the imp numbers up
to 100.

5. Future work
--------------
There is a relation between imp numbers, Euclid's algorithm, and
bombing patterns.  I'll try to work it out.

Now that I've been showing off my new cdb skills (two months ago I was
reading the docs for the first time), I guess I'll have to write the cdb
tutorial I promised to Beppe and Myer.

run and hit by BEPPE BEZZI

I pswitch 5 attack modules:

A very fast static, non booted, vector bomber mov <x,y followed by a quick
boot of Tornado

A booted away multiprocess vector vampire to a large pit, self clearing and
brainwashing. This is followed by a forward running continual dat clear.

shot1   mov     >0,     @vector1-A0

This is the module that, hanging your warrior, cused my victory against you
after a few wins yours and ties.

A Tornado bomber with multipass clear.

A stone--juliet storm.

A paper module, in case someone uses a single pass clear.

I'm too surprised of how good I did. In fact, having nothing to test it
against I tried to mix as many thing I was able to.

Back Propagation by M R BREMER

No one knew how they would fare this round, myself included--nothing to test
against, only vague ideas of what to expect.  Seeing Ivner's program after
the fact had me laughing.  I have lots of respect for an author who will
intentionally cause his program to die.  Anyways.  I operated on two lines of
thought:
        (1) everybody is going to vamp to a brainwashing pit.
        (2) everybody is going to use switching.

After all, that's what I was doing 8).  My program contains ten totally
independent vector vamping modules.  Each module throws 10 fangs of the type
jmp 50 (50 addresses later) jmp 50 (+50 spaces) . . . jmp pit.  I only need
two fangs per module instead of 10.  Is this better?  I have no idea.

A switching routine ( out of Jack in the box ) selects one of 5 strategies.
Each strategy executes module x and module x+5 yielding twenty fangs, 25
addresses apart.  At the end of module x is code to cleanse module x+5 by
using a-indirect bombing on it.  If I have been targeted by a fang, hopefully
I'll eliminate the pit with a mov #1, }1 bomb.  I think it should have been
a mov#1, }0.  Error #1.  Next the code totally eliminates the module, over-
writing it with dat 1, 1s.  Hopefully this will eliminate any stun attacks.
Of course module x+5 does the same of x.

Next launch two copies of Phoenix by Jippo.  Plenty of a-indirect bombing.
Hard on imps.  Of course I also have a backup continuous imp ring launcher
acquiried from Keystone.

By filling my code with pointers to locations 4000-4500, any bombing done
by the paper on my code will land on the enemy.

My pit is actually a jumper to two different pits.  One brainwashes and the
other pit just keeps growing.  Check it out at the very end of my source
listing.  Neither of my pits core clear.  Error #2.

It seems to have worked though.  Unbelievable.  Sorry it's so long.  I'm not
good with macros.

The Hint

This will be the last hint in Core_ Warrior_'s attempt to introduce basic
warrior strategies.  And we've saved the best for last, at least in my
opinion.  Vampires such as Sucker, Twilight Pits, Request, Snake, Pyramid,
and probably a host of others, used to rule the hills of old.  But then came
A-indirect addressing making anti-vamping much easier to do.  Silk Warrior
by Jippo incorporated a-indirect bombing in his replicator, which greatly
improved a vampire resistance.  Soon the slavers were dropping of the hills
in droves.  Vampires were thought to be obselete, but Paulsson's myVamp
continues to hold a top spot on the '94 hill so vamping could be your next
effective strategy.  Or has Paulsson come up with something unexpected?  Code
for a version ( perhaps the one on the hill ) is included for your review.
Magnus is very busy and didn't have time to offer his comments.  I would if
I could, but someone has my corewar disk (I don't own a computer), plus the
server for my university account can't access the internet right now.  *sigh*

The following comments were taken from a _PUSH OFF_ by P.Kline.  Hope he
doesn't mind.  Edited for clarity ( just kidding, sheesh ).

Basically a pit-trapper works by making your processes jump into a rapid-
splitting, core-clearing, self-destroying, nasty bit of code.  You are forced
to split many many processes, thereby robbing your healthy processes of time.
You are forced to erase the core, destroying any surviving components.  And
you finally erase the pit itself, killing your remaining processes.

Vampire strategy goes back to one of the standard battle programs, 'Vampire',
and was used successfully by Eugene P. Lilitko's Cowboy program to win the
1988 tournament.  Here's a modern version of Vampire:

fang  jmp trap,4

inc   spl #3364, #-3364 ; start here
      add inc,fang
      mov fang,@fang
      jmp -2

trap  mov 10,<-10       ; Of course this wouldn't have a prayer in stunning
      spl -1            ; today's paper.  How about mov, spl -1, spl -1,
      jmp -2            ; spl -1, jmp?

All vampires eventually cause their own processes to jump into the trap to
speed up the core clear (and to guarantee one).

Vampire's strengths include small size, rapid bombing (with fangs), and
complete core-clear.  Their most important feature, however is enslaving the
opponent's processes to do their dirty work.

Variations include booting the code to separate the bomber from the trap,
putting the fang in different locations, multiple spl's to more rapidly
overpower the opponent, and 'gates' to stop imps.

Areas to explore:
    What else can the pit do?
    Using multiple fang-bombers to better deal with stones.
    Evolving the fang-bomber into a repeating core-clear.
